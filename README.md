# Odin - Kubernetes Resource Collector and Inspector

Odin is a powerful, containerized application designed to collect, store, and inspect Kubernetes resources from multiple clusters. It features a modern React frontend and a robust FastAPI backend, providing an interactive and user-friendly experience for searching and analyzing resource configurations.

## Key Features

- **Modern React Frontend**: A fast, responsive, and intuitive user interface built with React and Vite.
- **Multi-Cluster Support**: Collects resources from any number of Kubernetes or OKD clusters.
- **Comprehensive Resource Collection**: Gathers a wide range of resources, including Pods, ConfigMaps, Secrets, Services, Deployments, StatefulSets, DaemonSets, Jobs, CronJobs, Ingresses, NetworkPolicies, PersistentVolumes (PVs), PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs), HorizontalPodAutoscalers (HPAs), and CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs).
- **MongoDB Backend**: Stores all resources as structured JSON documents, enabling flexible and powerful queries.
- **Resource Versioning & Auditing**: Tracks changes to resources over time by storing new versions and logging the differences.
- **RESTful API**: A robust FastAPI-powered API for all data operations.
- **Configurable Scheduled Data Collection**: A background job runs periodically to keep the resource data up-to-date. The interval is configurable via an environment variable.
- **Helm and CI/CD Ready**: Comes with a production-ready Helm chart and a complete GitLab CI/CD pipeline for automated deployments.
- **Robust Logging and Startup**: Features detailed structured logging for easy debugging and a fail-fast mechanism that prevents the app from starting without a valid database connection.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React, Vite, Axios
- **Backend**: Python 3, FastAPI, Loguru
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Deployment**: Docker, Docker Compose, Helm
- **CI/CD**: GitLab CI

## Deployment

There are two primary ways to deploy and run Odin: locally with Docker Compose for development and testing, or with the provided Helm chart for a production-grade Kubernetes deployment.

### 1. Local Development (with Docker Compose)

This method is ideal for local development and testing.

#### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

#### Setup
1.  **Configure Clusters:** Create a `clusters.yaml` file in the root of the project to define the clusters you want to monitor.
    ```yaml
    # clusters.yaml
    - name: my-cluster-1
      api_server: https://api.my-cluster-1.com:6443
      token_env: MY_CLUSTER_1_TOKEN
      namespace_label_selector: "environment=production" # Optional
      fqdn_env: MY_CLUSTER_1_FQDN # Optional: For generating clickable links
    ```

2.  **Set Environment Variables:** Create a `.env` file in the root directory for your cluster tokens and other configurations.
    ```env
    # .env
    MY_CLUSTER_1_TOKEN="your-kube-api-token-for-cluster-1"
    MY_CLUSTER_1_FQDN="console.apps.my-cluster-1.com" # Optional
    SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_HOURS=2 # Optional: Defaults to 1
    ```

3.  **Build and Run:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up --build
    ```
    The application will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. Production Deployment (with Helm)

The provided Helm chart is the recommended way to deploy Odin to a production Kubernetes cluster.

#### Prerequisites
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- A running Kubernetes cluster
- `kubectl` configured to connect to your cluster

#### Helm Chart Configuration
All configuration is managed in the `helm/values.yaml` file. Before deploying, you should customize this file to match your environment.

**Key values to configure:**
- `image.repository`: The URL of the Docker image repository where your Odin image is stored.
- `env.tokens`: A map of environment variable names to the **base64-encoded** tokens for your clusters.
- `env.fqdns`: A map of environment variable names to the FQDNs of your cluster UIs.
- `clustersConfig`: The raw YAML content defining your clusters, just like the `clusters.yaml` file.

#### Installation
1.  **Navigate to the Helm directory:**
    ```bash
    cd helm
    ```
2.  **Install the chart:**
    ```bash
    helm install <release-name> . --namespace <your-namespace> --create-namespace -f values.yaml
    ```
    Replace `<release-name>` and `<your-namespace>` with your desired values.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The project includes a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file that defines a complete CI/CD pipeline for automating the build, test, and deployment process.

### Pipeline Stages
1.  **Test:** Runs the backend `pytest` suite to ensure code quality.
2.  **Build:** Builds the multi-stage Docker image, which includes the compiled React frontend and the Python backend.
3.  **Push:** Pushes the built Docker image to your container registry (configured via GitLab CI/CD variables).
4.  **Deploy:** A manual-trigger job that uses the Helm chart to deploy the new version of the application to your Kubernetes cluster.

To use the pipeline, you will need to configure the necessary CI/CD variables in your GitLab project settings, such as `CI_REGISTRY_USER`, `CI_REGISTRY_PASSWORD`, and the credentials for your Kubernetes cluster.

## API Endpoints

For detailed information on all available API endpoints, you can access the interactive Swagger UI at `/docs` on your deployed instance.

- `GET /api/resources`: List and search for resources.
- `GET /api/resources/{resource_id}`: Inspect a single resource by its ID.
- `GET /filters/*`: Get unique values for filters like cluster names, namespaces, and resource types.
- `GET /api/related-namespaces`: Find all namespaces (and their corresponding clusters) where a resource with a specific name and type exists.
